# FastMCP v4 Migration Plan

> **Status:** Draft — 2026-08-04  
> **Target:** FastMCP 4.0.0 (currently 4.0.0b1 "Fourgone Conclusion")  
> **Current pin:** `fastmcp>=3.2.0,<3.4.5` / `mcp[cli]>=1.28.1,<2.0.0`

---

## Why This Matters

FastMCP 4 is a major version bump driven by the **2026-07-28 MCP specification**, which eliminates transport-level sessions. Every request is now self-describing; `initialize` handshakes are gone; capability negotiation moves to `server/discover`. This architectural shift is not cosmetic — it unlocks horizontal scaling without sticky sessions, enables a new class of interactive multi-step tools, and brings the project into alignment with where the MCP ecosystem is heading.

The good news: the core patterns in this codebase (lifespan context manager, yield-based pool lifecycle, synchronous handler functions wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread`) are preserved in v4. The migration is incremental rather than a rewrite.

---

## Strategic Value

| Capability | What it unlocks for teradata-mcp-server |
|---|---|
| **Sessionless protocol** | Stateless HTTP deployment; any replica handles any request — a prerequisite for running multiple server instances behind a load balancer |
| **`TasksExtension`** | `tdml_*` analytic functions (KMeans, XGBoost, etc.) can take minutes; background tasks let clients poll instead of blocking or timing out |
| **Guard-mode tools (`InputRequiredResult`)** | Multi-step confirmation flows for destructive `bar_*` and `sec_*` operations — server asks "are you sure?" before executing |
| **Argument completion** | Table and column name autocomplete for tool parameters — richer UX without extra round-trip tools |
| **Response caching hints** | Read-only `base_*` / `dba_*` tools can advertise cache TTLs; clients and gateways avoid redundant Teradata queries |
| **`ClientCredentialsOAuthProvider`** | Machine-to-machine auth for enterprise CI/CD pipelines and agent-to-agent calls without browser redirects |
| **Resource path security** | Built-in traversal protection on URI template resources — removes a class of injection risk |

---

## Dependency Map

Before any code changes, the full dependency floor must be met:

| Package | Current | Required for v4 |
|---|---|---|
| `fastmcp` | `>=3.2.0,<3.4.5` | `>=4.0.0` (pin to `==4.0.0b1` during evaluation) |
| `mcp[cli]` | `>=1.28.1,<2.0.0` | `>=2.0.0` |
| `pydantic` | implied | `>=2.12` |
| `fastapi` | implied | `>=0.133.0` |
| `starlette` | implied | `>=1.0.1` |
| `httpx` | no direct usage | replaced by `httpx2` in fastmcp internals — no source changes needed here |
| `truststore` | not present | pulled in transitively — affects TLS cert handling (OS trust store, not bundled certifi) |

> **Note on corporate CAs:** `truststore` reads from the OS certificate store rather than the bundled `certifi` bundle. Teradata environments using internal certificate authorities must ensure certs are installed at the OS level, not just added to a Python certifi bundle. This may require Docker image or VM config changes.

---

## Phase 0 — Spike and Validation Gate (1–2 weeks)

**Goal:** Confirm the migration is viable and surface any undiscovered issues before committing dev capacity.

### Work items

1. **Create an isolated evaluation branch** — pin `fastmcp==4.0.0b1` and `mcp>=2.0.0` in a throwaway `pyproject.toml` override. Run `uv sync` and confirm the dependency graph resolves without conflicts.

2. **Cold-start test** — run the server without a Teradata connection (`DATABASE_URI` unset) in stdio mode. Confirm the process starts, registers tools, and exits cleanly. This validates that the lifespan machinery, middleware registration, and tool decorator calls are all compatible.

3. **Verify internal FastMCP module paths** — the following import paths are used internally and are not part of FastMCP's public API contract. Check each still exists in v4:
   - `fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling.ErrorHandlingMiddleware`
   - `fastmcp.server.middleware.ping.PingMiddleware`
   - `fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_http_headers`
   - `fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_context`
   - `fastmcp.server.middleware.{CallNext, Middleware, MiddlewareContext}`

4. **Check `mcp_camelcase_compat` warning output** — run with the server briefly and observe deprecation warnings. The field names in `ToolAnnotations` (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) are camelCase from MCP SDK v1. SDK v2 moved to snake_case; the compat shim emits warnings. Confirm warnings are visible in log output so they are not silently masked.

5. **Evaluate beta stability** — FastMCP 4.0.0b1 was released 2026-07-28. Assess whether GA release is imminent or if the beta will be the basis for work for several weeks. Gate on this decision: proceed with beta, or wait for GA.

**Exit criterion:** Server cold-starts successfully with v4 pinned and all internal import paths verified.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Dependency and Protocol Upgrade (1–2 weeks)

**Goal:** Upgrade to FastMCP v4 and make the minimum changes required for the server to function correctly.

### 1.1 Dependency pins (`pyproject.toml`)

Update the version constraints:
```toml
# Before
"fastmcp>=3.2.0,<3.4.5",
"mcp[cli]>=1.28.1,<2.0.0",

# After
"fastmcp>=4.0.0",
"mcp[cli]>=2.0.0",
```

### 1.2 MCP SDK v2 snake_case field migration

MCP SDK v2 renames all protocol model fields from camelCase to snake_case. The `mcp_camelcase_compat` shim (default on) keeps the old names working with deprecation warnings, but they will be removed in a subsequent release. Migrate proactively.

**`app.py`** — `ToolAnnotations` constructor calls (lines 53–69):
```python
# Before
ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=True, idempotentHint=True)
ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=False, destructiveHint=True)

# After
ToolAnnotations(read_only_hint=True, idempotent_hint=True)
ToolAnnotations(read_only_hint=False, destructive_hint=True)
```

**`utils.py`** — `types.TextContent` is constructed with `type="text"` which is already correct. Verify no camelCase fields are used on other `mcp.types` objects.

### 1.3 Import path updates

**`app.py`** — `fastmcp.prompts.prompt` path is simplified:
```python
# Before
from fastmcp.prompts.prompt import Message, TextContent

# After
from fastmcp.prompts import Message, TextContent
```

Verify and update internal middleware import paths identified in Phase 0.

### 1.4 Disable `mcp_camelcase_compat` in CI

Add to the test environment to catch any remaining camelCase field usage early:
```python
import fastmcp
fastmcp.settings.mcp_camelcase_compat = False
```

**Testing:** Run the full integration test suite against a live Teradata database. All existing test cases should pass before moving to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Middleware Modernization (1–2 weeks)

**Goal:** Adapt the middleware layer to the sessionless protocol model.

### 2.1 `on_initialize` replacement for registry refresh

`RequestContextMiddleware.on_initialize` (middleware.py:207) is used to trigger a registry tool refresh when a new client session connects. In v4 on modern `2026-07-28` protocol, **`on_initialize` never fires** — there is no handshake. The server must handle this differently.

**Options (choose one):**

| Option | Trade-off |
|---|---|
| Move refresh to `on_request` with a time-based debounce (e.g. refresh at most once per N seconds) | Simple; refresh happens on first request after the interval elapses rather than at session start |
| Trigger refresh on a background schedule (e.g. using `asyncio.create_task` inside the lifespan) | Decoupled from requests; more predictable; slightly more code |
| Remove session-triggered refresh entirely; require server restart to pick up registry changes | Simplest; acceptable if registry changes are infrequent and deployments are cheap |

The recommended option is the **background schedule** approach, as it mirrors what the registry refresh is semantically trying to achieve (periodic sync) without depending on session lifecycle events that no longer exist.

### 2.2 Type guards in `on_request`

In v4, `on_request` (and `on_message`) fires for **every inbound message** — including `notifications/cancelled`, `notifications/initialized`, `notifications/progress`, and requests that fail validation. In v3 it only fired for routable requests.

`RequestContextMiddleware.on_request` (middleware.py:62) does not currently check the message type before processing. It will need a guard:

```python
async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next: CallNext):
    # Guard: skip non-routable messages
    if not hasattr(context, 'request') or context.request is None:
        return await call_next(context)
    # ... existing logic
```

The exact check depends on the v4 `MiddlewareContext` shape confirmed in Phase 0. Review the v4 `MiddlewareContext` API before writing the guard.

### 2.3 Confirm `set_state` / `get_state` within-request semantics

The pattern `context.fastmcp_context.set_state("request_context", rc)` (middleware.py:76) followed by `ctx.get_state("request_context")` (factory.py:11) stores a `RequestContext` object inside the middleware and retrieves it inside the tool handler. This is a within-request (within-call) flow, not a cross-request session flow.

Verify with a live test that this pattern continues to work under v4's sessionless model. The expectation is that it does — the state object is scoped to a single request's processing pipeline, which is unchanged — but confirm empirically.

### 2.4 QueryBand per-request vs per-session semantics

Currently, QueryBand is set once during `on_initialize` for a session and reused for all subsequent requests in that session. In a sessionless model every request is independent. Confirm that QueryBand is set on each request's connection (it is: `execute_db_tool` in `app.py` calls `_set_queryband` on each connection before running the tool). No change required here, but document the behaviour explicitly.

**Testing:** Manually test session-establishing clients (Claude Desktop, a direct MCP client) against the v4 server. Confirm QueryBand is correctly applied on every tool call. Verify log output shows the expected per-request context.

---

## Phase 3 — SSE Transport Deprecation (1 week)

**Goal:** Remove SSE as a supported transport before v4 completes its removal.

The MCP specification deprecated HTTP+SSE in the `2025-03-26` release. FastMCP v4 retains SSE support for now but it will not be a long-term option. The codebase currently supports three transports: `stdio`, `streamable-http`, and `sse`.

### Work items

1. **Identify active SSE users** — check configuration docs, deployment guides, and known client integrations for anyone relying on `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse`.

2. **Remove SSE from the transport enum** in `config/__init__.py` and the CLI argument validation in `server.py`.

3. **Update documentation and Docker Compose** — remove SSE examples; replace with `streamable-http` equivalents.

4. **Migration notice** — add a deprecation warning in v3.x release notes and/or a startup warning if SSE is configured, pointing users to streamable-http.

---

## Phase 4 — New Capability Adoption (2–4 weeks, can be split across releases)

These are independent features that can be shipped individually. Order them by value-to-effort.

### 4.1 `TasksExtension` for long-running analytic tools (High value)

`tdml_*` analytic functions — KMeans, XGBoost, ARIMA, and ~86 others — can run for minutes. Currently the MCP client must keep the connection open for the entire duration. With v4's `TasksExtension`, the tool returns immediately with a task ID; clients poll for completion.

**Implementation sketch:**
```python
from fastmcp_tasks import TasksExtension

mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension())

# Then @mcp.tool(task=True) on tdml_* wrappers
```

The tdml tool wrappers are generated inside `teradata_lifespan` — the `task=True` flag can be applied there. An in-memory backend is sufficient for single-instance deployments; Redis/Valkey is needed for multi-replica.

### 4.2 Argument completion for table and column names (Medium value)

Add a `@mcp.completion` handler for tool parameters that accept table or column names. The handler queries Teradata's information schema and returns matching values as the user types.

```python
@mcp.completion
async def complete_table_name(ref, argument, context):
    if argument.name == "table_name":
        # query DBC.TablesV for matches to argument.value
        ...
```

This surfaces across all tools that take a `table_name` parameter without any changes to the tool handlers themselves.

### 4.3 Response caching hints (Low effort, medium value)

`base_*`, `dba_*`, and `rag_*` tools are declared read-only and idempotent via `ToolAnnotations`. Pair this with v4's `cache_ttl` and `cache_scope` constructor parameters to give MCP clients and gateways explicit freshness signals:

```python
mcp = FastMCP(
    "teradata-mcp-server",
    lifespan=teradata_lifespan,
    mask_error_details=True,
    cache_ttl=300,       # 5 minutes for read-only tools
    cache_scope="public",
)
```

### 4.4 Guard-mode tools for destructive operations (Medium value, higher effort)

`bar_*` (backup/restore) and specific `sec_*` operations are marked `destructiveHint=True`. Use `InputRequiredResult` to gate them behind a confirmation step:

```python
from fastmcp import InputRequiredResult

async def handle_bar_drop_table(table_name: str, ctx):
    if not ctx.input_responses:
        return InputRequiredResult(
            message=f"Drop table '{table_name}'? This is irreversible.",
            response_type=bool,
        )
    if not ctx.input_responses[0]:
        return "Operation cancelled."
    # proceed
```

This is most impactful for operations invoked from agentic workflows where the LLM might otherwise proceed without human confirmation.

---

## Phase 5 — Horizontal Scaling Readiness (Future / stretch goal)

With the sessionless protocol in place after Phases 1–3, the server is ready in principle for multi-replica deployment. Formalising this requires:

1. **Shared session state backend** — replace the in-memory `_ConnState` holder with a shared store if per-user state is needed across replicas.
2. **`UserSession` primitive** — explicitly scope per-user auth context using v4's `UserSession` rather than relying on per-process state.
3. **`RequestStateSecurity`** — if guard-mode tools are in use across replicas, configure a shared key so opaque `requestState` tokens are verifiable by any replica.
4. **`ClientCredentialsOAuthProvider`** — add machine-to-machine authentication for automated pipeline scenarios.

This phase depends on the deployment architecture decision (single instance vs fleet) and is not required for v4 compatibility.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internal FastMCP module paths (middleware, dependencies) change without notice in v4 | Medium | Medium | Validate every import path in Phase 0 spike; switch to public API alternatives where available |
| `on_initialize` removal breaks registry refresh for clients that rely on per-session tool list refresh | High | Medium | Phase 2.1 — design the background-schedule alternative before merging v4 upgrade |
| `mcp_camelcase_compat` shim masks latent field-name bugs until it is removed in a future version | Low | Low | Disable the shim in CI (Phase 1.4) |
| TLS failures in environments using internal CAs after `truststore` replaces `certifi` | Medium | High for enterprise | Test against corporate CA environment in Phase 1; update Docker base image cert setup |
| FastMCP 4.0.0b1 introduces regressions before GA | Low-Medium | Medium | Pin to the exact beta version during evaluation; upgrade to GA before merging to main |
| `set_state` / `get_state` within-request semantics silently break | Low | High | Explicit integration test in Phase 2.3 before shipping |

---

## Suggested Sequencing

```
Phase 0  ──► Phase 1  ──► Phase 2  ──► Phase 3
 (spike)    (upgrade)   (middleware)   (SSE removal)
                                            │
                                            ▼
                                       Phase 4 (features, can ship independently)
                                            │
                                            ▼
                                       Phase 5 (scaling, future)
```

Phases 0–3 are the migration proper and should be treated as a single contiguous workstream. Phase 4 items are enhancements that can be scoped into normal feature releases after the migration is stable.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Beta or wait for GA?** FastMCP 4.0.0b1 was released 2026-07-28. The spike in Phase 0 will reveal whether the API is stable enough to commit to. If the GA release is within a few weeks, waiting is low risk.

2. **Which Phase 4 feature ships first?** `TasksExtension` (long-running analytics) has the clearest operational value. Argument completion is lower effort and directly improves UX. These can proceed in parallel if bandwidth allows.

3. **SSE client inventory** — who is currently using `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse`? This determines how much lead time Phase 3 needs before removal.

4. **Multi-replica intent** — if horizontal scaling (Phase 5) is on the near-term roadmap, the middleware design in Phase 2 should account for it now rather than requiring a second refactor.
